## Keep Modding

This project extends the excellent [Keep Driving](https://www.whycjwhy.com/keepdriving/index.html) game with the latest iteration of the [Aurie Framework](https://github.com/AurieFramework/Aurie). Its goal is to let you extend the game.

### Current state
Um, it won't delete your computer I guess? It needs the Aurie Manager to catch up to the rest of the framework before it can be used more broadly.

### Features (planned)
- Add new activities - maybe even new assets? Abilities? Items? Hitchhikers? Quests? I don't know what can be done!
- Patch .kdr files to set your own values/dialogue/etc.
- Load your own .kdr files.
